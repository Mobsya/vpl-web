We intend to release VPL 3 as open source when VPL 3 is officially released.
More specifically:

- the graphical assets will be released under CC-BY-NC-ND-4;
- the source code, configuration files, build files etc. will be released
  under BSD-3;
- the trademarks and logos will remain the exclusive property of their
  respective owners.

The content of this file will be changed when VPL 3 is officially released.

Until then, all the VPL 3 files are under embargo.
